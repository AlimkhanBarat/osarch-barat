# tldr - extracting an archive without reading eight screens of prose
**Presented:** week 6, Alimkhan Barat / Damir Niyazbek

## The problem
The built-in `man` pages are overwhelmingly long and detailed. Finding the correct combination of flags for a simple, everyday task (like extracting an archive) requires reading through pages of dense technical prose. We proved this live by running `man tar | wc -l`, which outputs over a thousand lines.

## What we showed
`tldr tar` / `tldr ss`
Instead of full documentation, it instantly outputs the most practical, ready-to-use commands for creating archives and troubleshooting network sockets.

**Offline capability** (`sudo ip link set ens33 down` -> `tldr chmod`)
We demonstrated how it provides simple, human readable examples for standard file permissions even when the virtual machine is completely disconnected from the internet, thanks to its local cache.

## When to reach for it
When you know which command you need but forgot the exact syntax or flags for a standard, everyday operation. Do not use it if you need deep system configuration, rare parameters. For those, you still need the built-in `man` pages.

## Installing
- Linux: `sudo apt install tealdeer` (run `tldr --update` on first use to download the local cache)
- Windows: `winget install tldr`
